# My QMK Configs
Backups of my QMK configs. Feel free to try them out, or take inspiration from them.

  
# Layouts
## onth
My default Planck layout
Adaptable for the Let's Split and similar boards
copy contents of folder to qmk_firmware/keyboards/planck/keymaps/onth
make planck/rev6:onth:dfu-util
## onth2
An adapted version of onth made for Linux work. Made for the Plaid, but it's close enough to easily modify for the Planck.
### Usage
Colemak by default. Swapped out the ability to switch to QWERTY or Dvorak because I don't use them.

Standard-ish planck default layout, with lower and raise keys. Left middle key is backspace, hold it for nav mode where you can easily move the arrow keys without moving your fingers off the home row.

Bottom left key is mouse mode. Made to push with your palm. Lets you mouse around.
